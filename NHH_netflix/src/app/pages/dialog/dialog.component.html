    <h3>Incredible tooling</h3>
    <p>Build features quickly with simple, declarative templates. Extend the template language with
      your own components and use a wide array of existing components. Get immediate Angular-specific
      help and feedback with nearly every IDE and editor. All this comes together so you can focus
      on building amazing apps rather than trying to make the code work.</p>
  
    <h3>Loved by millions</h3>
    <p>From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the productivity and scalable
      infrastructure that supports Google's largest applications.</p>
  
    <h3>What is Angular?</h3>
  
    <p>Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular
      combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated
      best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build
      applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop</p>
  
    <h3>Architecture overview</h3>
  
    <p>Angular is a platform and framework for building client applications in HTML and TypeScript.
    Angular is itself written in TypeScript. It implements core and optional functionality as a
    set of TypeScript libraries that you import into your apps.</p>
  
    <p>The basic building blocks of an Angular application are NgModules, which provide a compilation
    context for components. NgModules collect related code into functional sets; an Angular app is
    defined by a set of NgModules. An app always has at least a root module that enables
    bootstrapping, and typically has many more feature modules.</p>
